## Build From Source

to compile and test desktop app on your local machine
follow these steps.

1. Clone the project
2. Install the [JBR](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsRuntime/releases)
   1. If you extract it to your home directory and don't want to modify global `JAVA_HOME` environment variable you can set `JAVA_HOME` to the extracted directory e.g. `export JAVA_HOME=~/jbrsdk_jcef-21.0.4-linux-x64-b620.4` for linux or `$env:JAVA_HOME="C:\path\to\jbr"` on Windows
3. cd into the project, open your terminal and execute the following commands
4. select which way you want to compile the app
<details>
<summary>Packaged (msi,deb at the moment)</summary>

```bash
./gradlew

./gradlew packageReleaseDistributionForCurrentOS
```

This will create an installer package for your **current OS**, so you can install it on your own

>Note: you will get error if your OS does not support any of above package types in this case you should compile it `without packaging`

</details>

<details>
<summary>Without Package</summary>

In case you don't want to package it or your OS does not support those package types you can use this command to compile the app without packaging it
```bash
./gradlew

./gradlew createReleaseDistributable
```
It will create an output folder

>NOTE: this is not packaged you may package it yourself manually, or just simply run it!

>I suggest you to move the output somewhere else if you want to run it directly

</details>

The output will be created in

```
<project_dir>/desktop/app/build/compose/binaries/main-release/
```


> **Note**. This project is compiled and published by GitHub actions [here](./.github/workflows/publish.yml), so if you
> faced any problem you can check that too
